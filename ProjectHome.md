## Epub and MP3 metadata/tag transliter ##

### The program will update metadata in all files in the selected folder( and subfolders if checked) ###


1. Tested on Windows XP only, but should work fine on Vista and Win 7 - no support for Apple OS, Unix, Linux  or others.

2. There is no rollback (lat to cyr) functionality yet (coming in the next version) - so make sure you have a backup, in case you want to keep original Cyrillic metadata info

3. No installation required -  just unzip into folder run ktanc2e.exe.

4. Command line arguments supported - read ReadMe.txt for more information.

5. Use at your own risk  -  report all issues and bugs to me.

6. Any functionality/improvements  suggestions are welcome.

7. Friendly donations for “hard work”  in the form of lunch, cognac  or 1 million
dollars  are appreciated (other variations will be considered as well).

8. Free to use and distribute (see item # 7 above).
